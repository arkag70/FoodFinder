* This is about a population who float around the canvas during their fixed lifespan. 
* They start moving around randomly. 
* There is a food placed in the canvas.
* The first generation is clueless about food, but second generation onwards it has
  a sense of direction to move closer to food
* The main goal is to use the previous data to train them to find food
